# factoriomousecontrol

This script lets you control the character of factorio with your mouse.
If the the right mouse button is pressed, the character will run towards the mouse (limited to 8 directions due to factorio) unless the mouse is in the center of screen deadzone (currently 15%, variable in the script).


## Installation
- Install autohotkey (www.autohotkey.com)
- Run factorio.ahk
- Have Fun
